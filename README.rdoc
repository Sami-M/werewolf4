== Welcome to Werewolf Mafia

Werewolf Mafia is a social mobile game that allow users to play as wolves and 
townsfolk as both groups work against each other for total victory. Mobile 
devices are used so that wolves can "smell blood" and find victims via location.
Townsfolk can decide who they can eliminate within their town in the day via vote
in hopes to eliminate another werewolf before night.
